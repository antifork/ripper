.B RiPPeR 1.2-beta \- Routing Table Corrupter 

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ripper [-r route] [-m metric] [-g gateway] [-n netmask] [-i interface] [-p password] [-x sniff passowrd] [-a read file] [-s spoofed address] [-dfch]

.SH DESCRIPTION
RiPPeR is a RIPv2 routing table corrupter. It can inject evil routes on a 
selected router in LAN environment and can also check if they have been 
injected correctly. RiPPeR offers the possibility to spoof the source 
address but with some restrictions, read the README for more informations. 
In general RiPPeR pretends to be a full-featured RIPv2 routing daemon.
